Create a Java application which will accept as input a binary number and return as output the decimal value of that number. Do not use built-in functions. You must loop through the binary number and calculate the value of each position.

Format the output as follows:
The decimal value of 10011100 is 156

Test data:
01100111 = 103
00000000 = 0
11111111 = 255
11110111 = 247
